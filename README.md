# HeadFirstDesignPatterns

This is code that goes along with the Head First Design Patterns book.

I'm not following the book 100%, so some classes might be different or omitted compared to the book.

## Building

There is no main(), but you can run the checks and tests by typing the following
at a terminal:

```shell
gradlew check
```
